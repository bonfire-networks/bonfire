# Bonfire Spark

An essential Bonfire extension that sets up the other extensions and starts the app.

NOTE: this extension uses top-level naming for the OTP app (`:bonfire`) and modules (`Bonfire.`).

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/bonfire_app>.
