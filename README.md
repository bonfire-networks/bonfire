# Bonfire 

An essential Bonfire extension that bootstraps any other enabled extensions and starts the app. Also includes views such as the homepage and dashboard.

See https://github.com/bonfire-networks/bonfire-app for an example umbrella app (actually a [poncho](https://embedded-elixir.com/post/2017-05-19-poncho-projects/) since Bonfire is not a monorepo) if you want to run this, and https://bonfirenetworks.org for details about Bonfire.
